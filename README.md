## How the Application Runs
The application takes an unsorted list and runs the algorithms design until the list is fully sorted.
Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm. It is a comparison sort that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
